# installation

## npm

### install tailwind
* npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli

To build the .css files from tailwind:

# Setup

The user can setup the django settings.py to their preference, here we provide an overview of the envs that need to be set for some common use cases

## Envs

We recommend the use of the `direnv` package to store your envs in a local file .envrc. The listed environment variables are captured in `.envrc_template`. The user may wish to copy this file and save as `.envrc` (used by direnv).
